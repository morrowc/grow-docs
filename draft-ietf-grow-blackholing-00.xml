		<abstract>
			<t>
				This document describes the use of a well-known Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
				community for blackholing at IP networks and Internet Exchange Points (IXP). This well-known 
				advisory transitive BGP
				community, namely BLACKHOLE, allows an origin AS to specify that a neighboring IP network or IXP 
				should blackhole a specific IP prefix.

		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>
				The network infrastructure has been getting hammered by DDoS attacks for years. In order to block 
				DDoS attacks, IP networks have offered BGP blackholing to neighboring networks (<xref target="
				RFC3882">iBGP scenarios</xref> and <xref target="RFC5635">RTBH filtering</xref>), much like some 
				IXPs have recently started to do. 
			</t>

			<t>
				DDoS attacks targeting a certain IP network may cause congestion of links used to connect to other 
				networks. In order to limit the impact of such a scenario on legitimate traffic, IP networks and 
				IXPs adopted a mechanism
				called BGP blackholing. A network that wants to trigger blackholing needs to understand the 
				triggering mechanism adopted by its neighboring IP networks and IXPs. Different IP networks and
				IXPs provide different BGP mechanisms to trigger blackholing, including pre-defined blackhole next-
				hop IP addresses and pre-defined BGP communities.
			</t>

			<t>
				Having several different mechanisms to trigger blackholing at 
				different IP networks and IXPs makes it an unnecessarily complex, error-prone and cumbersome task
				for network operators.
				Therefore a well-known <xref target="RFC1997">BGP community</xref> is defined for operational ease.
			</t>

			<t>
				Having such a well-known BGP community for blackholing
				also supports IP networks and IXPs because
				<list style='symbols'>
                	<t> implementing and monitoring blackholing gets easier if implementation
                		and operational guides do not cover many options that trigger blackholing
                	</t>
                	<t> the number of support requests from customers about how to trigger
                		blackholing at a particular IP network or IXP will be reduced as the mechanism is
                		unified
                	</t>
            	</list>
			</t>

			<t>
				Making it considerably easier for network operators to utilize blackholing makes operations
				easier.

		<section anchor="attribute" title="BLACKHOLE Attribute">
			<t>
				This document defines the use of a new well-known BGP transitive community,
   				BLACKHOLE.
   			</t>

   			<t>
  			 	The semantics of this attribute allow a network to interpret
   				the presence of this community as an advisory qualification to drop
   				any traffic being sent towards this prefix.
   			</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="recommendation" title="Operational Recommendations">
			<section anchor="morespecific" title="IP Prefix Announcements with BLACKHOLE Community Attached">
				<t>
					When an IP network is under DDoS duress, it MAY announce an IP prefix covering the victim's IP
					address(es) for the purpose of signaling to neighboring IP networks or IXPs that any traffic
					destined for these IP address(es) should be discarded. In such a scenario, the network
					operator SHOULD attach BLACKHOLE BGP community.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="scope" title="Local Scope of Blackholes">
				<t>
					A BGP speaker receiving a BGP announcement tagged with the BLACKHOLE BGP community SHOULD add a 
					NO_ADVERTISE, NO_EXPORT or similar community to prevent propagation of this route outside the
					local AS.
				</t>

				<t>
					Unintentional leaking of more specific IP prefixes to neighboring networks can have adverse
					effects. Extreme caution should be used when purposefully propagating IP prefixes tagged with
					the BLACKHOLE BGP community outside the local routing domain.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="small" title="Accepting Blackholed IP Prefixes">
				<t>
					It has been observed that announcements of IP prefixes larger than /24 for
					IPv4 and /48 for IPv6 are usually not accepted on the Internet 
					(see <xref target="RFC7454">section 6.1.3</xref>). However, blackhole routes should be as
					small as possible in order
					to limit the impact of discarding traffic for adjacent IP space that is not under DDoS duress.
					Typically, the blackhole route's prefix length is as specific as /32 for IPv4 and /128
					for IPv6.
				</t>
				<t>
					BGP speakers SHOULD only accept and honor BGP announcements carrying the
					BLACKHOLE community if the announced prefix is covered by a shorter
					prefix for which the neighboring network is authorized to advertise.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="control" title="IXPs: Peering at Route Servers">
				<t>
					Many IXPs provide the so-called policy control feature as part of their route servers
					<xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server" /> (see e.g. the
					<eref target="https://www.linx.net/members/support/route-servers.html">LINX website</eref>). 
					Policy control allows members to
					specify, by using BGP communities, which ASNs connected to the route server receive a particular 
					BGP announcement.
				</t>
				<t>
					Combined usage of the BGP communities for blackholing and policy control allows a fine-grained
					control of a blackhole.
				</t>

				<t>
					In some implementations of blackholing at IXPs, the route server after receiving a BGP 
					announcement tagged with the BLACKHOLE BGP community rewrites the next-hop IP address 
					to the pre-defined blackholing IP address before redistributing the announcement.
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
			<t>
				The IANA is requested to register BLACKHOLE as a well-known BGP community with global significance:
				<list>
					<t>
						BLACKHOLE (= 0xFFFF029A)
					</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				The low-order two octets in decimal are 666, amongst IP network operators a value commonly
				associated with BGP blackholing.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>
				BGP contains no specific mechanism to prevent the unauthorized modification of information by the 
				forwarding agent. This allows
				routing information to be modified, removed, or false information to be added by forwarding agents. 
				Recipients of routing information
				are not able to detect this modification. Also, <xref target="RFC6810">RPKI</xref> and
				<xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview">BGPSec</xref> do not fully
				resolve this situation. For instance, BGP communities can still be added
				or altered by a forwarding agent even if RPKI and BGPSec are in place.
			</t>
			<t>
				The BLACKHOLE BGP community does not alter this situation.
			</t>

			<t>
				A new additional attack vector is introduced into BGP by using the BLACKHOLE BGP community: denial
				of service attacks for IP prefixes.<!--Elaborate on the possible danger of -->
			</t>
			<t>
				The unauthorized addition of the BLACKHOLE BGP community to an IP prefix by a forwarding agent may 
				cause a denial of service
				attack based on denial of reachability. The denial of service will happen if an IP network or IXP 
				offering blackholing is traversed.
				However, denial of service attack vectors to BGP are not new as the injection of false routing 
				information is already possible.
			</t>

			<t>
				In order to further limit the impact of unauthorized BGP announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE BGP 
				community, the receiving BGP speaker SHOULD verify by applying strict filtering
				(see <xref target="RFC7454">section 6.2.1.1.2.</xref>) that the peer
				announcing the prefix is authorized to do so. If not, the BGP announcement should be filtered out.
			</t>
			
			<t>
				The presence of this BLACKHOLE BGP community may introduce a resource exhaustion attack to BGP 
				speakers. If a BGP speaker receives many IP prefixes containing the BLACKHOLE BGP community, its 
				internal resources such as CPU power and/or memory might get consumed,
				especially if usual prefix sanity checks (e.g. such as IP prefix length or number of prefixes) are 
				disabled (see <xref target="small" />).

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a well-known community [RFC1997], called
   GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN, for the purpose of reducing the management
   overhead of gracefully shutting down BGP sessions.  The well-known
   community allows implementers to provide an automated graceful
   shutdown mechanism that does not require any router reconfiguration
   at maintenance time.

   Routing changes in BGP can be caused by planned maintenance
   operations.  This document discusses operational procedures to be
   applied in order to reduce or eliminate loss of packets during a
   maintenance.  Loss comes from transient lack of
   reachability during BGP convergence which follows the shutdown of an

   EBGP peering session between two Autonomous System Border Routers
   (ASBR).

   This document presents procedures for the cases where the forwarding
   plane is impacted by the maintenance, Graceful Restart does not apply
   during this type of maintenance event.

   The procedures described in this document can be applied to reduce or
   avoid packet loss for outbound and inbound traffic flows initially
   forwarded along the peering link to be shut down.  These procedures
   trigger, in both ASes, rerouting to alternate paths if they exist
   within the AS, while allowing the use of the old path until alternate
   ones are learned.  This ensures that routers always have a valid
   route available during the convergence process.

   The goal of the document is to meet the requirements described in
   [RFC6198] at best, without changing the BGP protocol.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   graceful shutdown initiator: a router on which the session shutdown
   is performed for the maintenance.

   graceful shutdown receiver: a router that has a BGP session, to be
   shutdown, with the graceful shutdown initiator.

   Initiator AS: the Autonomous System of the graceful shutdown
   initiator.

   Receiver AS: the Autonomous System of the graceful shutdown receiver.

   Loss of Connectivity (LoC: the state when a router has no path toward
   an affected prefix.

3.  Packet loss upon manual EBGP session shutdown

   Packets can be lost during a manual shutdown of an EBGP session for
   two reasons.

   First, routers involved in the convergence process can transiently
   lack paths toward an affected prefix, and drop traffic destined to
   this prefix.  This is because alternate paths can be hidden by nodes
   of an AS.  This happens when the paths are not selected as best by
   the ASBR that receive them on an EBGP session, or by Route Reflectors
   that do not propagate them further in the IBGP topology because they
   do not select them as best.

   Second, within the AS, the FIB of routers can be transiently
   inconsistent during the BGP convergence and packets toward affected
   prefixes can loop and be dropped.

   This document only addresses the first reason.

4.  Practices to avoid packet losses

   This section describes means for an ISP to reduce the transient loss
   of packets upon a manual shutdown of a BGP session.

4.1.  Make before break convergence: graceful shutdown

   The goal of this procedure is to retain paths which transit between
   between peers which are shutting down a bgp session by 
   lowering LOCAL_PREF and allowing the paths to remain in use while
   alternate paths are selected and propagated.  The LOCAL_PREF value
   must be lower than the one of the alternate path. 0 being the lowest
   value, it can be used in all cases, except if it already has a
   special meaning within the AS.

   Section 5 describes configurations and actions to be performed for
   the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions.

5.  EBGP graceful shutdown procedure

   This section describes configurations and actions to be performed for
   the graceful shutdown of EBGP peering links.

5.1.  Pre-configuration

   On each ASBR supporting the graceful shutdown receiver procedure, an
   inbound BGP route policy is applied on all EBGP sessions of the ASBR,
   that:

   o  matches the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community

   o  sets the LOCAL_PREF attribute of the paths tagged with the
      GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community to a low value

Internet-Draft        Graceful BGP session shutdown            July 2017


5.2.  Operations at maintenance time

   On the graceful shutdown initiator, at maintenance time, the operator
   must:

   o  apply an outbound BGP route policy on the EBGP session to be
      shutdown.  This policy tags the paths propagated over the session
      with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community.  This will trigger the BGP
      implementation to re-advertise all active routes previously
      advertised, and tag them with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community.

   o  apply an inbound BGP route policy on the EBGP session to be
      shutdown.  This policy tags the paths received over the session
      with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community and sets LOCAL_PREF to a low
      value.

   o  wait for convergence to happen.

   o  shutdown the EBGP session, optionally using
      [I-D.ietf-idr-shutdown] to communicate the reason of the shutdown.

   In the case of a shutdown of the whole router, in addition to the
   graceful shutdown of all EBGP sessions, there is a need to gracefully
   shutdown the routes originated by this router (e.g, BGP aggregates
   redistributed from other protocols, including static routes).  This
   can be performed by tagging these routes with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
   community and setting LOCAL_PREF to a low value.

5.3.  BGP implementation support for graceful shutdown

   BGP Implementers SHOULD provide configuration knobs that utilize
   the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community to drain bgp neighbors in
   preparation of impending neighbor shutdown. Implementation details
   are outside the scope of this document.

6.  Beyond EBGP graceful shutdown

6.1.  IBGP graceful shutdown

   For the shutdown of an IBGP session, provided the IBGP topology is
   viable after the maintenance of the session, i.e, if all BGP speakers
   of the AS have an IBGP signaling path for all prefixes advertised on
   this graceful shutdown IBGP session, then the shutdown of an IBGP
   session does not lead to transient unreachability.  As a consequence,
   no specific graceful shutdown action is required.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned the community value 0xFFFF0000 to the planned-
   shut community in the "BGP Well-known Communities" registry.  IANA is
   requested to change the name planned-shut to GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN and
   set this document as the reference.

Internet-Draft        Graceful BGP session shutdown            July 2017


8.  Security Considerations

   By providing the graceful shutdown service to a neighboring AS, an
   ISP provides means to this neighbor and possibly its downstream ASes
   to lower the LOCAL_PREF value assigned to the paths received from
   this neighbor.

   The neighbor could abuse the technique and do inbound traffic
   engineering by declaring some prefixes as undergoing a maintenance so
   as to switch traffic to another peering link.

   If this behavior is not tolerated by the ISP, it SHOULD monitor the
   use of the graceful shutdown community.

Appendix A.  Alternative techniques with limited applicability

   A few alternative techniques have been considered to provide graceful
   shutdown capabilities but have been rejected due to their limited
   applicability.  This section describe them for possible reference.

A.1.  Multi Exit Discriminator tweaking

   The MED attribute of the paths to be avoided can be increased so as
   to force the routers in the neighboring AS to select other paths.

   The solution only works if the alternate paths are as good as the
   initial ones with respect to the Local-Pref value and the AS Path
   Length value.  In the other cases, increasing the MED value will not
   have an impact on the decision process of the routers in the
   neighboring AS.

A.2.  IGP distance Poisoning

   The distance to the BGP NEXT_HOP corresponding to the maintained
   session can be increased in the IGP so that the old paths will be
   less preferred during the application of the IGP distance tie-break
   rule.  However, this solution only works for the paths whose
   alternates are as good as the old paths with respect to their Local-
   Pref value, their AS Path length, and their MED value.

   Also, this poisoning cannot be applied when nexthop self is used as
   there is no nexthop specific to the maintained session to poison in
   the IGP.
